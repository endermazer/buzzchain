BuzzChain: Microservices on the blockchain powered by artificial intelligence and big data with massive scalability and nanosecond finality enabled by concurrent proof of stake.
================

To learn more about BuzzChain, please read the [White Paper](TBD)

Applications
--------

#### Presence-level Virtual Reality and true-Earth-physics Augmented Reality
Both are possible with BuzzChain's planetary scale hyper-threading with error correction.

#### Decentralized Banking and Transfers
BuzzChain will bank the unbanked, unbank the banked, permission the permissionless, and censor the uncensorable.

### Sentient Contracts
Contracts imbued with artifical intelligence allows unstoppable and indepedendent contracts to live in the blockchain with decision-making agency.

#### Space Exploration
Nanoblocks allow high throughput data and code to flow to and from from satellites, space colonies, and unmanned missions to Mars and beyond.
